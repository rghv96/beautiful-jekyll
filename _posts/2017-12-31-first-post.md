Few minutes left to the new year. 2017 is about to end and I still need a clickbait or social tantrums to gain attention. Yeah I setup my personal blog. finally. Its even public after so may failed private blog attempts. I have met some amazing people at college which are my friends and I thank them for making 2017 a little less shittier. I have always taken my friends for granted. One more semester and every one would disperse. Let's hope that the new year be less of crap, less of loneliness, more time with friends. Cheers!
